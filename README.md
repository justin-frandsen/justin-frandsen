# Justin Frandsen

Ph.D. student in Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience at **Texas A&M University**. My research focuses on the mechanisms of visual attention and learning in complex, naturalistic environments. I use behavioral methods, eye tracking, and neuroimaging to investigate how people attend to their environment.

## Research Interests
- Visual attention and statistical learning  
- Scene grammar and object-location regularities  
- Aversive conditioning and attentional bias  
- Saliency modeling and image-based analysis  

## Current Projects
- **Statistical Learning in Visual Search**  
  Investigating how learned regularities in object locations and scene context influence search behavior.  

- **Saliency and Threat Detection in Fire Imagery**  
  In collaboration with the Yorzinski Lab, applying saliency models (GBVS) and image segmentation techniques to examine how fire draws visual attention.  

## Tools & Methods
- Programming: Python, MATLAB, R  
- Experiment design: Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy  
- Eye tracking: EyeLink 1000, DataViewer  
- Statistical analysis: pandas, NumPy, tidyverse, SPSS, JASP  
- Image processing: OpenCV, scikit-image
